<h4><strong>The Network as a Service Market Size is Anticipated to Exceed USD 136 Billion by 2033, Growing at a CAGR of 26.55% from 2023 to 2033.</strong></h4>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sphericalinsights.com/reports/network-as-a-service-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Network as a Service (NaaS)</strong>&nbsp;</a>market is set to reach USD 136 billion by 2033, growing at a robust CAGR of 26.55% during the forecast period from 2023 to 2033. NaaS, a cloud-based model where clients lease networking services from cloud providers, removes the need for maintaining infrastructure. Similar to&nbsp;<strong>SASE</strong>&nbsp;(Secure Access Service Edge), NaaS integrates software-defined networking with network security features, offering an effective alternative to traditional networking setups such as&nbsp;<strong>VPNs</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>MPLS</strong>, and on-premise hardware like&nbsp;<strong>firewalls</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>load balancers</strong>. NaaS was developed to address inefficiencies in managing internal&nbsp;<strong>WANs</strong>&nbsp;and the shift of business processes to the cloud. The solution offers several advantages, including flexibility, scalability, remote accessibility, reduced maintenance requirements, bundled security, and cost savings.</p>
