<p><a href="https://www.sphericalinsights.com/reports/chemical-mechanical-planarization-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP)</strong></a>&nbsp;is a critical process used to smooth and planarize surfaces, particularly in semiconductor manufacturing. This process, which involves both chemical and mechanical actions, helps adjust height disparities between neighboring structures (local planarization) or across the entire substrate surface (global planarization). CMP is vital for creating high-quality, polished surfaces on materials such as metals, polysilicon, and dielectrics. It plays a key role in producing advanced microelectronics and multilayer systems. Originally developed for planarizing silica, CMP has since evolved to handle more complex materials like polymeric dielectrics and metal interconnects. The increased demand for higher processing power has led to CMP becoming crucial in industries such as photovoltaics, automotive technology, and radio frequency (RF) applications.</p>
<h3>Market Overview</h3>
<p>The global Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP) market is poised to surpass USD 11.86 billion by 2033, expanding at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.11% from 2023 to 2033. As the demand for microelectronic device processing power rises, CMP procedures have become more complex, with advanced materials like Cu and Ge being utilized in manufacturing sectors that require high efficiency and frequency.</p>
