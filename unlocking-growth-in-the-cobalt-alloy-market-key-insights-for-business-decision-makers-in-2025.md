<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sphericalinsights.com/reports/cobalt-alloy-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>global cobalt alloy market</strong></a>&nbsp;is expected to grow significantly, with projections to reach USD 15.8 billion by 2033, expanding at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.04% from 2023 to 2033. This growth is fueled by the increasing demand for high-performance materials across several key industries, including aerospace, automotive, medical, and energy. Cobalt alloys are prized for their exceptional properties such as high-temperature strength, corrosion resistance, and wear resistance, making them essential for critical applications like aerospace components, joint replacements, and energy-efficient technologies.</p>
<p>The market is further supported by rising industrialization in developing regions and strategic initiatives such as the U.S. Pentagon&rsquo;s $20 million grant for the construction of a cobalt refinery in Ontario, Canada. This move is part of a broader effort by the U.S. government to diversify the cobalt supply chain away from China. Additionally, cobalt alloys play a crucial role in advancing energy efficiency technologies, particularly in electric vehicle batteries and renewable power systems, broadening their market scope.</p>
