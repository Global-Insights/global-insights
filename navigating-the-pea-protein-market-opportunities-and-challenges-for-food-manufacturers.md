<h4><strong>The Pea Protein Market Size is Anticipated to Exceed USD 5.87 Billion by 2033, Growing at a CAGR of 11.48% from 2023 to 2033.</strong></h4>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.sphericalinsights.com/reports/pea-protein-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global Pea Protein Market</a></strong>&nbsp;is anticipated to exceed USD 5.87 billion by 2033, growing at a robust CAGR of 11.48% from 2023 to 2033. Pea protein, derived from yellow peas, is quickly becoming a popular plant-based protein substitute for animal proteins. It is rich in essential amino acids, hypoallergenic, and ideal for vegan, vegetarian, and allergen-free diets. Unlike other plant proteins, pea protein has low cholesterol and fat content, supporting muscle growth, aiding weight management, and promoting heart health. It is also more easily digestible than many plant-based proteins, minimizing digestive discomfort and bloating.</p>
<p>As the demand for plant-based diets grows, driven by health, environmental, and ethical reasons, pea protein is increasingly used in protein powders, energy bars, and plant-based meat alternatives, establishing itself as a staple in numerous food products. Its sustainability and growing consumer preference are fueling its market expansion.</p>
